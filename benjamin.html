      <h2>DNDIY</h2>
      <p>Hey!<br><br> I am in the process of making a website called DNDIY-do not do it yourself.<br><br> Its an open source website for mad science! The purpose is something similar to Instructables and Wikipedia. Someone is supposed to put an idea on the site, and other people would presumably edit and develop it Wikipedia style. It would be a community for people to invent and develop things. Anybody could input a project, and anybody could develop a project.<br> Presumably, when you get many people working on one project things amazing things happen! World problems would be solved! People would go to space!...maybe.<br><br>Currently it is a static site written by hand using html, and it is hosted in github. It has tenticles that go to another hosting datbase. The database is running tikiwiki as the open source development engine. The site in concept is sound, and very possible, but the current website doesnt work well and has poor flow.<br><br> What do I need? <br>*artistic flow <br>*someone who can figure out "smartie templates" and smooth out my bucking wikitiki engine <br>*a "technology tree" map and a search engine.<br>*an abilty to comment/troll, and a viability button to use when commenting. <br> *I'm open for ideas and disscussion!<br></p>
      <p>The navigation bar is up top of this page, the two most important parts of the site right now are the <a href="http://dndiy.org/  ">index</a> and the <a href="project.html">Projects</a> tab. There are no other mebers or community effort yet!</p>
