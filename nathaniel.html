      <h1>Top Secret Info For N Philip Cole Only!</h1>

      <h2>My Problems</h2>
      <p>I started making a website with no knowledge of how to make websites, or code. Originally with notepad, and now sublime. I may seem like an idiot, but my persistance is impressive and things get better with time.<br> The website is a rough work in progress with bugs, and it is basic right now.<br> the goal of the website is to have strong wikipedia/forum elements so people can input their own projects and have an open source development forum, with searchable features, and mobile friendly options, and an abilty to comment/troll.<br> Since people don't really browse websites anymore, its foucs is really just a central hub, and the projects will be hosted and shared on other websites like Facebook, Google plus, Youtube, Instructables ect. As people share these terrible educational blurbs, it will be free advertising and viral marketing pyramid schemes. <br>Really, all I need is one instructional video on how to make a tesla coil barbecue and cook food with lightning to get interest, but I'd prefer the web structure to be a little more firm before really going "live". The website is up right now.</p>
      <p>As a starter I am inputing projects I have been working on for material and a good base.</p>
      <p>I hear there are these really cool things called a CMS? I'm diving into jekyll and github too. Im trying to find generic editable forum software code, and wikipedia style material. Design advice, ideas, pointers?</p>

      <h2>Do Not Do It Yourself - </h2> <p> A Project series/website/organization I've been working on</p>
      <p>A series of instructions or educational blurbs on how to make things - things you often shouldnt be doing.</p>
      <p>The idea is to make a series of projects, presented like a gamers technology tree. This "tree" on a grand scale could include the wheel, and end with the ...singularity? It would give educational advide how to make things, and develop the things you currently have in an open source fashion.</p>
      <p>Example <br> Still-> Charcoal-> activated charcoal -> gas mask. <br> charcoal ->BBQ Grill-> ->Kiln -> Forge <br> Welder -> Trailer -> Bicycle</p> 
      <p>Gregs version of this is extremly lofty goals that won't succeed, but thats not the point. <br> The goal is to "really go for it" until we fall flat on our faces for sensationalism and humor. <br>For example, I have designs for a very interesting (and explosive) space ship, powered by hydrogen and carbon monoxide, made from trash bags and scrap. From my calculations it will make it 20 miles to the edge of the stratosphere but not make it to space...but someone across the world may see this terrible idea and realize something I didn't, and put a design improvement.viability score - troll focus or a why not function, bad idea score - rating system goes up to 11. .. greg quits his job at mercedes, goes frelance crazy?
