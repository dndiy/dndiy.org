      <h1>Space Overview</h1>
      <img class="imgr" src="images/gallery/thumbs/weldthumb.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" />
      <p>The Space series is a series of projects intended to compete with the Google X Prize - a 25 million dollar prize for private companies to a robot on the moon.</p>
      <p> In our apocalyptic post modern society, it is commonly accepted that groups of people with years of education and large budgets make amazing things. We share tailored, dramatic photos and videos of these supermen flexing their brains. We feel inspired and amazed at this modern age we live in.</p>
      <p>Truthfully, it takes hard work and buracracy to accomplish anything, teamwork takes effort and years of a project can be condensed into a 30 minute success documentary glazing over the less desirable aspects.</p>
      <p> I have a GED and a dysfunctional love for adventure. I want to be there in the space race, taking my rocket to the stars. I won't listen to any budget constaints or educational restrictions. The universe is vast and doesn't care how well my resume looks. Also, it is very cool and sexy to be an astronaught.</p>

      <h2>Projected Series Path</h2>
      <p> The first episode is the homemade welder, the next oddly enough is a barbecue. With the concept of a barbecue, we will make a biomass gasifier, with the biomass gasifier we will be making hydrogen balloons. we will be launching the hydrogen ballons to the edge of the atmosphere. At this stage it gets a little fuzzy, the edge of the amosphere is about 20 miles, and space starts around 600 miles. The concept we are currently grappling with is somehow accellerating the ballon to 25,000 miles per hour for escape velocity. the hydrogen in the ballons can be used as a fuel, but we dont have oxygen at the edge of the atmosphere, and I stongly suspect the size of the balloon may have drag even at the edge of space and the question of how huch fuel is needed hasnt been answered yet. the advantage of this project is is extreme low cost, if one of our space ballons explode we can make more from a trash can. we burn the garbage and use the bag as a balloon. can hydrogen and carbon monoxide burn to produce acceleration? we have an excess of this stuff.
