      <h1>Top Secret Info For Sarah Giffrow!</h1>

      <h2>DNDIY</h2>
      <p>Hey Sarah!<br><br> I am in the process of making a website called DNDIY-do not do it yourself.<br> Its an open source website for mad science! The purpose is something similar to Instructables and Wikipedia. Someone is suppoosed to put an idea on the site, and other people would presumably edit and develop it Wikipedia style. It would be a community for people invent and develop things. Anybody could input a project, and anybody could develop a project.<br> Presumably, when you get many people working on one project things amazing things happen! I also beleive that the concept of ownership of ideas is bad for scientific development. If many people could input and develop, growth would be an exponent. World problems would be solved! People would go to space!...maybe.<br><br>Currently it is a static site written by hand using html, and it is hosted in github. It has tenticles that go to another hosing datbase. The database is running tikiwiki as the open source development engine. The idea is sound, and very possible, but the website is a trainwreck that doesnt work well and has poor flow.<br> What do I need? <br>*artistic flow <br>* someone who can figure out "smartie templates" and smooth out my bucking wikitiki engine <br>*a "technology tree" map and a search engine.<br>*an abilty to comment/troll.<br> *im open for ideas and disscussion!<br><br>Oh, and I would be happy to help you with your automotive needs in an equal value trade!</p>
      <p>The navigation bar is up top of this page, the two most important parts of the site right now are the index page (dndiy logo)and the projects tab. There are no other mebers or community effort yet!</p>
