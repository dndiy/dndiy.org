      <h1>Tools Overview</h1>
      <img class="imgr" src="images/gallery/thumbs/weldthumb.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" />
      <p>The intent of the tools series exists because of a quote and an argument that was very elequently said by the late Douglas Adams in his Hitchhikers Guide series. </p>
      <p>&quot The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little to offer him because he had little to offer them. He had been extremely chastened to realize that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and Armagnac, he didn't, by himself, know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich and that was it. &quot  </p>
      <p>The statement indicates that if you, were dropped into a forest on a strange planet, you would be helpless when your flashlight runs out of batteries, you could not even have toast. Although there is some truth to this statement, we do stand on the shoulders of the successive efforts of our fellow humans and the rotting corpses of our forefathers^x. There is several million years develoment of our species making a sharpening exponential curve into the infinite singularity of the future. </p>
      <p> I have even seen videos of people trying to construct a toaster and failing.</p>
      <p>Yet, with these facts placed obviously in my face, I disagree. I say I can make a toaster. A Rube Goldberg Toaster machine that will fire toast into orbit. The marvels of our developed society were ultimately made by the hands of men, and I have 2 of them.</p>

      <h2>Intended Path</h2>

      <p>There isnt much of a plot to this series. The majority of the projects are made simply because they are awesome or they are stepping stones to other projects and are often included in the other series lineups. There will be a toaster some day. We also recognize that some of the tools included here considered axiomatic in nature are constructed of other things that are society dependant and can be considered plot holes for the idea of making anything entirely from scratch. An example, the homemade welder uses batteries so you couldn't make a welder stranded on another planet. Well, google &quot how to make a battery &quot and make one. While your grappling with this awkward exponential explosion, I will be welding over here with my awsome homemade tool okay? </p>
