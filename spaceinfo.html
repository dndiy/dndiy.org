      <h1>Space Overview</h1>
      <img class="imgr" src="images/gallery/thumbs/weldthumb.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" />
      <p>The Space series is a parody of projects intended to compete with the Google X Prize - a 25 million dollar prize for private companies to put a robot on the moon.</p>
      <p>It is our belief that people do not attempt to make it to space because of the danger, lack of education, the scale of the projects, and the widspread opinion that these things are better accomplished by more educated individuals. Also, money is a problem. Weather or not any of these popularly held opionions is true, public opinion puts pressure on people who would attempt spacey activities, telling them they are unreasonable or crazy.</p>
      <p>For our projects we will take up this mantle of unreasonable crazy and build a series of items that will eventually launch things into space...or just crash and burn. Whatever. We are doing a service to mankind, and maybe one or two of our ideas will be worth something and adapted into later projects.</p>

      <h2>Projected Series Path</h2>
      <p> The first episode is the homemade welder, and cart for welder. The next oddly enough is a barbecue. With the concept of a barbecue, we will make a biomass gasifier. With the biomass gasifier we will be making hydrogen balloons. we will be launching the hydrogen ballons to the edge of the atmosphere. At this stage it gets a little fuzzy, the edge of the amosphere is about 20 miles, and space starts around 600 miles. The concept we are currently grappling with is somehow accellerating the ballon to 25,000 miles per hour for escape velocity. The hydrogen in the ballons can be used as a fuel, but we dont have oxygen at the edge of the atmosphere. I stongly suspect the size of the balloon may have drag even at the edge of space. The question of how huch fuel is needed hasn't been answered yet. The advantage of this project is is extreme low cost. Most items are out of a trash can.
