Hey!

Most of this website was hand coded in notepad by an unexperienced individual so don't be mean!

Intent of website is to present dndiy to the public.
Dndiy is a project series that makes some very dubious how-to videos.
Later projects are intended to be built using elements from earlier projects until you have a metiphorical house of cards.

The intent of the website is supposed to mirror this goal, after the introductory home page,and the about pages, 
episodes are supposed to be divided into different project series - each project series is inteneded to have an overall
goal...like curing cancer, or making world peace.
Clicking on the "mini series" section should bring a list of projects,
and if a project requires elements from earlier projects it should be called level 2 and 3 ect. Earlier projects can feed
into several later projects making a technological tree.
Ultimate series goals are intneded to be extreme and lofty. We expect to fail or fall on itself at some point. The 
unknown is when.

The bulk of information on the videos ect, is expected to be hosted elsewere, the website is just a hub and a
handy navigational tool for those who want to explore project in depth.

All involved members should also get a tab explaining themselves and their involvment in project. We will also
provide links or additional information if the individual wants to push their own personal services ect.
